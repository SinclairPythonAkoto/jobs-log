Jobs Log

This is a basic web app that creates a table visble for the viewer to see after they submit entries from the homepage.

When the user submits their entry, it is stored into a database; it is then sent back to the page (from the database) in order for the user to view.

My previous version of this used SQLite3 and ran the app locally; now I will be using PostgreSQL and running the app remotely.
